"""
Scenario 1: Single Job Execution

Details:  
  TestName: testSingleJobExecution
  Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of calculateLateness method when a single job is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Job object with a specific processing time and deadline.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created Job object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the startTime and lateness of the job are correctly calculated.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the calculateLateness method correctly calculates the startTime and lateness for a single job. This is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Multiple Jobs Execution In Order

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsExecutionInOrder
  Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of calculateLateness method when multiple jobs are passed in deadline order. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Job objects with specific processing times and deadlines in ascending order.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created Job objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the startTimes and lateness of the jobs are correctly calculated.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the calculateLateness method correctly calculates the startTimes and lateness for multiple jobs and maintains the order. This is significant as it validates the sorting mechanism of the method.

Scenario 3: Multiple Jobs Execution Out Of Order

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsExecutionOutOfOrder
  Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of calculateLateness method when multiple jobs are passed in a random deadline order. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Job objects with specific processing times and deadlines in a random order.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created Job objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the startTimes and lateness of the jobs are correctly calculated and jobs are in deadline order.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the calculateLateness method correctly calculates the startTimes and lateness for multiple jobs and sorts the jobs based on their deadlines. This is significant as it validates the sorting functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Jobs Execution With Same Deadlines

Details:  
  TestName: testJobsExecutionWithSameDeadlines
  Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of calculateLateness method when multiple jobs with the same deadline are passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Job objects with specific processing times and the same deadline.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created Job objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the startTimes and lateness of the jobs are correctly calculated.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the calculateLateness method correctly calculates the startTimes and lateness for jobs with the same deadline. This is significant as it tests the method's handling of identical deadlines.

Scenario 5: No Jobs Execution 

Details:  
  TestName: testNoJobsExecution
  Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of calculateLateness method when no jobs are passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No jobs to arrange.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with no jobs.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method behaves as expected when no jobs are passed.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the calculateLateness method can handle a scenario where no jobs are passed. This is significant as it tests the method's robustness.
