Scenario 1: Valid Job Creation

Details:  
  TestName: validJobCreation
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'of' method can successfully create a new Job object with valid jobName, processingTime, and deadline parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize jobName, processingTime, and deadline variables with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the 'of' method with the initialized variables as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Job object is not null and its parameters match the input.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the 'of' method can correctly create a new Job object when provided with valid parameters. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application can create Job objects as expected.

Scenario 2: Job Creation with Empty jobName

Details:  
  TestName: jobCreationWithEmptyJobName
  Description: This test is meant to check how the 'of' method handles the situation where an empty string is passed as the jobName parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize jobName as an empty string, and processingTime and deadline with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the 'of' method with the initialized variables as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Job object is null or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed at verifying how the application handles creating a Job with an empty jobName. This test is significant as it checks the application's robustness when dealing with invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Job Creation with Negative processingTime

Details:  
  TestName: jobCreationWithNegativeProcessingTime
  Description: This test is meant to check how the 'of' method handles the situation where a negative value is passed as the processingTime parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize jobName with a valid string, processingTime with a negative value, and deadline with a valid value.
  Act: Invoke the 'of' method with the initialized variables as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Job object is null or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed at verifying how the application handles creating a Job with a negative processingTime. This test is significant as it checks the application's robustness when dealing with invalid inputs.

Scenario 4: Job Creation with Negative deadline

Details:  
  TestName: jobCreationWithNegativeDeadline
  Description: This test is meant to check how the 'of' method handles the situation where a negative value is passed as the deadline parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize jobName and processingTime with valid values, and deadline with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the 'of' method with the initialized variables as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Job object is null or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed at verifying how the application handles creating a Job with a negative deadline. This test is significant as it checks the application's robustness when dealing with invalid inputs.

Scenario 5: Job Creation with Null jobName

Details:  
  TestName: jobCreationWithNullJobName
  Description: This test is meant to check how the 'of' method handles the situation where null is passed as the jobName parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare and initialize jobName as null, and processingTime and deadline with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the 'of' method with the initialized variables as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Job object is null or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed at verifying how the application handles creating a Job with a null jobName. This test is significant as it checks the application's robustness when dealing with null inputs.
