"""
Scenario 1: Test with Single Job
Details:  
  TestName: testWithSingleJob
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method calculateLateness works correctly with a single job.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a specific processing time and deadline.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created job.
  Assert: Check if the job's startTime is zero, and lateness is calculated correctly.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the lateness for a single job. It's significant because it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test with Multiple Jobs
Details:  
  TestName: testWithMultipleJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method calculateLateness works correctly with multiple jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with different processing times and deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check if the jobs' startTimes and lateness are calculated correctly.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the lateness for multiple jobs. It's significant because it checks the functionality of the method with more complex inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with Jobs Finishing Before Deadline
Details:  
  TestName: testWithJobsFinishingBeforeDeadline
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method calculateLateness works correctly when jobs finish before their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create jobs with processing times less than their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check if the jobs' lateness is zero.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles the case where jobs finish before their deadline. It's significant because it tests the method's behavior in this specific scenario.

Scenario 4: Test with Jobs Finishing After Deadline
Details:  
  TestName: testWithJobsFinishingAfterDeadline
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method calculateLateness works correctly when jobs finish after their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create jobs with processing times greater than their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check if the jobs' lateness is greater than zero.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles the case where jobs finish after their deadline. It's significant because it tests the method's behavior in this specific scenario.

Scenario 5: Test with No Jobs
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNoJobs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method calculateLateness handles the case with no jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not create any jobs.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with no jobs.
  Assert: Check if the method does not throw any exceptions.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles the case with no jobs. It's significant because it checks the method's error handling.
