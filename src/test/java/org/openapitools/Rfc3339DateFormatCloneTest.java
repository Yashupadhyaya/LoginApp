"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate if the clone method returns the same object

Details:  
  TestName: testCloneMethodReturnsSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the clone method is returning the same object. This is to ensure that the clone method is functioning as expected. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of RFC3339DateFormat.
  Act: Invoke the clone method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned object with the original instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the clone method is returning the same object. The expected result is that the clone method should return the same object since it's not a deep clone. This test is significant as it ensures that the clone method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if the clone method is working when called multiple times

Details:  
  TestName: testCloneMethodWhenCalledMultipleTimes
  Description: This test is meant to check if the clone method is functioning correctly even when called multiple times. It is to ensure that the method is robust and can handle multiple calls. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of RFC3339DateFormat.
  Act: Invoke the clone method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare each returned object with the original instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the clone method returns the same object even when called multiple times. The expected result is that the clone method should return the same object every time. This test is significant as it ensures that the clone method is robust and can handle multiple calls.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if the clone method is thread-safe

Details:  
  TestName: testCloneMethodThreadSafety
  Description: This test is meant to check if the clone method is thread-safe. It is to ensure that the method can be accessed by multiple threads without causing any unintended side effects. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of RFC3339DateFormat.
  Act: Invoke the clone method on the instance from multiple threads.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare each returned object with the original instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the clone method is thread-safe. The expected result is that the clone method should return the same object from each thread. This test is significant as it ensures that the clone method can be safely accessed by multiple threads.
