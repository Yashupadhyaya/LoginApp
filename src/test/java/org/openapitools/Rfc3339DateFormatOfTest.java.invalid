"""
Scenario 1: Standard Job Creation

Details:  
  TestName: createStandardJob.
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful creation of a Job instance with standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string for jobName, and integers for processingTime and deadline.
  Act: Invoke the of method with these parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Job instance is not null and its fields match the input parameters.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the Job instance is correctly created with the provided parameters. This is significant as it is the basic functionality of the of method.

Scenario 2: Job Creation with Empty Job Name

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithEmptyName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when an empty string is provided as the jobName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty string for jobName, and integers for processingTime and deadline.
  Act: Invoke the of method with these parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an exception is thrown or if the returned Job instance has an empty jobName.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify how the of method handles empty jobName. It's significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Job Creation with Negative Processing Time

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithNegativeProcessingTime.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when a negative integer is provided as the processingTime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string for jobName, a negative integer for processingTime and an integer for deadline.
  Act: Invoke the of method with these parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an exception is thrown or if the returned Job instance has a negative processingTime.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify how the of method handles negative processingTime. It's important in ensuring that the method can handle negative values.

Scenario 4: Job Creation with Zero Deadline

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithZeroDeadline.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when zero is provided as the deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string for jobName, an integer for processingTime and zero for deadline.
  Act: Invoke the of method with these parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an exception is thrown or if the returned Job instance has a zero deadline.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify how the of method handles zero deadline. It's significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.
