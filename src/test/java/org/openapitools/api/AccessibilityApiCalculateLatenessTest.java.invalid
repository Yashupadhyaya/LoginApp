"""
Scenario 1: Test with single job, finishing before deadline

Details:  
  TestName: testSingleJobBeforeDeadline
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there is only one job which finishes before its deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a processing time less than the deadline.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Assert that the lateness of the job is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the job started and finished before its deadline and hence lateness is 0. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly calculates the lateness when a job finishes before its deadline. 

Scenario 2: Test with single job, finishing after deadline

Details:  
  TestName: testSingleJobAfterDeadline
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there is only one job which finishes after its deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a processing time greater than the deadline.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Assert that the lateness of the job is greater than 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the job started and finished after its deadline and hence lateness is greater than 0. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly calculates the lateness when a job finishes after its deadline. 

Scenario 3: Test with multiple jobs, all finishing before their deadline

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsBeforeDeadline
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there are multiple jobs and all finish before their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with their processing times less than their respective deadlines.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Assert that the lateness of all jobs is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that all jobs started and finished before their deadlines and hence their lateness is 0. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly calculates the lateness when multiple jobs finish before their deadlines. 

Scenario 4: Test with multiple jobs, some finishing after deadline

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsSomeAfterDeadline
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there are multiple jobs and some finish after their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with their processing times being greater than their respective deadlines for some.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Assert that the lateness of the jobs finishing after their deadline is greater than 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that some jobs started and finished after their deadlines and hence their lateness is greater than 0. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly calculates the lateness when multiple jobs finish after their deadlines. 

Scenario 5: Test with multiple jobs, all finishing after their deadline

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsAllAfterDeadline
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there are multiple jobs and all finish after their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with their processing times being greater than their respective deadlines.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Assert that the lateness of all jobs is greater than 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that all jobs started and finished after their deadlines and hence their lateness is greater than 0. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly calculates the lateness when all jobs finish after their deadlines.

Scenario 6: Test with no jobs

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNoJobs
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculateLateness method when there are no jobs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not create any jobs.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with no jobs.
  Assert: Assert that no exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle the scenario where there are no jobs. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly handles edge cases.
