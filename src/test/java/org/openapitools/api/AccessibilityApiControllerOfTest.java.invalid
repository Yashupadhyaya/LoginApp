Scenario 1: Successful creation of Job object

Details:  
  TestName: successfulJobCreation
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful creation of the Job object when valid parameters are provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string as jobName, two integers as processingTime and deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the of method with the jobName, processingTime and deadline. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the created Job object is not null and the attributes of the Job object are the same as the parameters provided. This test is significant to ensure that the Job object is created correctly when valid parameters are provided.

Scenario 2: Creation of Job object with empty jobName

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithEmptyName
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when an empty string is passed as the jobName. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty string as jobName, two integers as processingTime and deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the of method with the empty jobName, processingTime and deadline. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the created Job object is not null but the jobName attribute of the Job object is an empty string. This test is significant to ensure that the of method can handle an empty jobName.

Scenario 3: Creation of Job object with negative processingTime

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithNegativeProcessingTime
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when a negative integer is passed as the processingTime. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string as jobName, a negative integer as processingTime and an integer as deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the of method with the jobName, negative processingTime and deadline. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the created Job object is not null but the processingTime attribute of the Job object is a negative integer. This test is significant to ensure that the of method can handle a negative processingTime.

Scenario 4: Creation of Job object with negative deadline

Details:  
  TestName: createJobWithNegativeDeadline
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the of method when a negative integer is passed as the deadline. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string as jobName, an integer as processingTime and a negative integer as deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the of method with the jobName, processingTime and negative deadline. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the created Job object is not null but the deadline attribute of the Job object is a negative integer. This test is significant to ensure that the of method can handle a negative deadline.
