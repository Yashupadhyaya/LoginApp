"""
Scenario 1: Test when a single job is processed before its deadline
Details:  
  TestName: testSingleJobBeforeDeadline.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the lateness is calculated correctly when a single job finishes before its deadline. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a processing time less than its deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Check if the lateness of the job is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the lateness is 0 when a job finishes before its deadline. 
  This test is significant to ensure the correctness of the lateness calculation logic.

Scenario 2: Test when a single job is processed after its deadline
Details:  
  TestName: testSingleJobAfterDeadline.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the lateness is calculated correctly when a single job finishes after its deadline. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job with a processing time greater than its deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Check if the lateness of the job is greater than 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the lateness is greater than 0 when a job finishes after its deadline. 
  This test is significant to ensure the correctness of the lateness calculation logic.

Scenario 3: Test with multiple jobs with different deadlines
Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsWithDifferentDeadlines.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and the lateness is calculated correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with different deadlines. 
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check if the jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and the lateness is calculated correctly.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and the lateness is calculated correctly. 
  This test is significant to ensure the correctness of the sorting and lateness calculation logic.

Scenario 4: Test with multiple jobs with the same deadline
Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleJobsWithSameDeadline.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and the lateness is calculated correctly even when the jobs have the same deadline. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs with the same deadline. 
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created jobs.
  Assert: Check if the lateness is calculated correctly for all jobs.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the lateness is calculated correctly for all jobs even when they have the same deadline. 
  This test is significant to ensure the correctness of the lateness calculation logic when jobs have the same deadline.

Scenario 5: Test with no jobs
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNoJobs.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the calculateLateness method works correctly when there are no jobs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not create any jobs. 
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with no jobs.
  Assert: Check if the method doesn't throw any exceptions.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method doesn't throw any exceptions when there are no jobs.
  This test is significant to ensure the robustness of the calculateLateness method.
