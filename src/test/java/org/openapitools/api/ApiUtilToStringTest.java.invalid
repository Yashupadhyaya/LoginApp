Scenario 1: Test to check correct string formatting of Job instance

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectStringFormattingOfJobInstance
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Job entity correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Job instance with jobName, processingTime, and deadline.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Job instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string output against the expected string format.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation of a Job instance. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the string representation of a Job instance is correctly formatted, which is crucial for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Test to check string formatting of Job instance with zero processing time

Details:  
  TestName: testStringFormattingOfJobInstanceWithZeroProcessingTime
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Job entity correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance when the processing time is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Job instance with jobName, zero processing time, and deadline.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Job instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string output against the expected string format.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance even when the processing time is zero. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation of a Job instance. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the string representation of a Job instance is correctly formatted regardless of the processing time, which is crucial for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 3: Test to check string formatting of Job instance with negative lateness

Details:  
  TestName: testStringFormattingOfJobInstanceWithNegativeLateness
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Job entity correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance when the lateness is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Job instance with jobName, processingTime, and deadline such that the lateness is negative.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Job instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string output against the expected string format.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the string representation of the Job instance even when the lateness is negative. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation of a Job instance. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the string representation of a Job instance is correctly formatted regardless of the lateness, which is crucial for debugging and logging purposes.
