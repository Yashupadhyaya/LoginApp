Scenario 1: Test to check the lateness calculation when all jobs finish before their deadlines

Details:
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithNoDelay
  Description: This test is designed to verify the lateness calculation when all jobs are processed within their deadlines. The jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and processed in that order. Since all jobs finish before their deadlines, the lateness for all jobs should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of jobs such that all jobs can be completed before their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created array of jobs.
  Assert: Check that the lateness for all jobs is 0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly calculates lateness when all jobs finish before their deadlines. The expected result is zero lateness for all jobs because they all finish on time. This is significant in understanding how the method handles scenarios where all jobs are completed on time.

Scenario 2: Test to check the lateness calculation when all jobs finish after their deadlines

Details:
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithAllJobsDelayed
  Description: This test is designed to verify the lateness calculation when all jobs are processed after their deadlines. The jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and processed in that order. Since all jobs finish after their deadlines, the lateness for all jobs should be greater than 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of jobs such that all jobs finish after their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created array of jobs.
  Assert: Check that the lateness for all jobs is greater than 0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly calculates lateness when all jobs finish after their deadlines. The expected result is positive lateness for all jobs because they all finish late. This is significant in understanding how the method handles scenarios where all jobs are delayed.

Scenario 3: Test to check the lateness calculation when some jobs finish before and some after their deadlines

Details:
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithMixedJobCompletion
  Description: This test is designed to verify the lateness calculation when some jobs are processed within their deadlines and some after. The jobs are sorted based on their deadlines and processed in that order. The lateness for jobs that finish on time should be 0 and greater than 0 for jobs that finish late.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of jobs such that some jobs finish before and some after their deadlines.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the created array of jobs.
  Assert: Check that the lateness for jobs that finish on time is 0 and greater than 0 for jobs that finish late.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly calculates lateness when there is a mix of jobs that finish on time and late. The expected result is zero lateness for jobs that finish on time and positive lateness for jobs that finish late. This is significant in understanding how the method handles scenarios with a mix of on-time and late jobs.

Scenario 4: Test to check the lateness calculation when there are no jobs

Details:
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithNoJobs
  Description: This test is designed to verify the lateness calculation when there are no jobs. Since there are no jobs, the method should not throw any exceptions or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array of jobs.
  Act: Invoke calculateLateness with the empty array of jobs.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions or errors are thrown.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles scenarios when there are no jobs. The expected result is that no exceptions or errors are thrown. This is significant in understanding how the method handles edge cases.
