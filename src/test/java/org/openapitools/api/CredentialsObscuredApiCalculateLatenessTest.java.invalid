"""
Scenario 1: Testing the calculateLateness method with a single job.
 
Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithSingleJob.
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the calculateLateness method's functionality with a single job.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single job using the 'of' method.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the created job.
  Assert: Check if the job's startTime is 0 and lateness is 0 as the job is supposed to finish before the deadline.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the lateness and start time for a single job. This test is crucial to ensure that the method can handle the simplest case of a single job.

Scenario 2: Testing the calculateLateness method with multiple jobs finishing before the deadline.

Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithMultipleJobsBeforeDeadline.
  Description: This test is to verify that the calculateLateness method can accurately calculate the lateness for multiple jobs that finish before their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs using the 'of' method with deadlines set after their respective processing times.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with these jobs.
  Assert: Assert that all the jobs have their lateness as 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the lateness for multiple jobs finishing before their deadlines. This test is important to ensure the method's correct behavior with multiple jobs.

Scenario 3: Testing the calculateLateness method with multiple jobs finishing after the deadline.

Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithMultipleJobsAfterDeadline.
  Description: This test is to verify that the calculateLateness method can accurately calculate the lateness for multiple jobs that finish after their deadline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple jobs using the 'of' method with deadlines set before their respective processing times.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with these jobs.
  Assert: Assert that all the jobs have their lateness as the difference between their start time and deadline.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the lateness for multiple jobs finishing after their deadlines. This test is crucial to ensure the method's correct behavior with jobs that finish late.

Scenario 4: Testing the calculateLateness method with no jobs.

Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithNoJobs.
  Description: This test is to verify that the calculateLateness method can handle the scenario where no jobs are passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no jobs are to be created.
  Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with no jobs.
  Assert: No assertion is needed as no jobs are passed.
Validation: 
  This test scenario verifies that the method can handle the edge case where no jobs are passed. It is important to ensure that the method can handle such edge cases without throwing any exceptions.
