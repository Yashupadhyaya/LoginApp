Scenario 1: Testing the calculateLateness method with jobs that finish before their deadlines

Details:  
TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithEarlyJobs
Description: This test is meant to check the calculateLateness method when all jobs finish before their deadlines. It aims to validate that the lateness of each job is correctly calculated as 0.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an array of Job objects, ensuring that the processing time of each job is less than its deadline.
Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the array of Job objects. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the lateness of each job is 0.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the lateness of each job is 0, which is the expected behavior when a job finishes before its deadline. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly handles this common scenario.

Scenario 2: Testing the calculateLateness method with jobs that finish after their deadlines

Details:  
TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithLateJobs
Description: This test is meant to check the calculateLateness method when all jobs finish after their deadlines. It aims to validate that the lateness of each job is correctly calculated as the difference between the finish time and the deadline.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an array of Job objects, ensuring that the processing time of each job is greater than its deadline.
Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the array of Job objects. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the lateness of each job is equal to the difference between the finish time and the deadline.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the lateness of each job is calculated correctly, which is the expected behavior when a job finishes after its deadline. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly handles cases where jobs are late.

Scenario 3: Testing the calculateLateness method with an empty array of jobs

Details:  
TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithEmptyJobs
Description: This test is meant to check the calculateLateness method when it is invoked with an empty array of jobs. It aims to validate that the method does not throw any exceptions and correctly handles this edge case.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty array of Job objects.
Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the empty array. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions are thrown.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty array of jobs, which is an edge case that could occur in practice. This test is significant to ensure that the method is robust and does not fail in unexpected ways. 

Scenario 4: Testing the calculateLateness method with jobs that have the same deadlines

Details:  
TestName: testCalculateLatenessWithSameDeadlines
Description: This test is meant to check the calculateLateness method when all jobs have the same deadlines. It aims to validate that the method correctly sorts the jobs and calculates their lateness.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an array of Job objects, ensuring that all jobs have the same deadline.
Act: Invoke the calculateLateness method with the array of Job objects. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the jobs are sorted correctly and their lateness is calculated correctly.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly sorts the jobs and calculates their lateness, which is the expected behavior when all jobs have the same deadline. This test is significant to ensure that the method correctly handles this special case.
