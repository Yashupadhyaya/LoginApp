Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct redirection of the index method

Details:
  TestName: testIndexRedirection
  Description: This test is meant to check if the index method in HomeController correctly redirects to "swagger-ui.html".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HomeController and set expectations for the "index" method to return "redirect:swagger-ui.html".
  Act: Invoke the index method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is "redirect:swagger-ui.html".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the index method correctly redirects to "swagger-ui.html". The expected result is based on the method's defined functionality. This test is significant as it ensures that the application's routing and redirection functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure the index method does not redirect to an incorrect URL

Details:
  TestName: testIncorrectRedirection
  Description: This test is meant to check that the index method does not redirect to any URL other than "swagger-ui.html".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HomeController and set expectations for the "index" method to return "redirect:swagger-ui.html".
  Act: Invoke the index method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the result does not match an incorrect URL.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the index method does not redirect to any URL other than "swagger-ui.html". The expected result is based on the method's defined functionality. This test is significant as it ensures that the application's routing and redirection functionality is working as expected and does not lead to unintended locations.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure the index method handles null return

Details:
  TestName: testNullReturn
  Description: This test is meant to check that the index method does not return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HomeController and set expectations for the "index" method to return "redirect:swagger-ui.html".
  Act: Invoke the index method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the result is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the index method does not return null. The expected result is based on the method's defined functionality. This test is significant as it ensures that the application's routing and redirection functionality does not lead to a null pointer exception.
